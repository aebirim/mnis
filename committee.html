        <h3>Overview<div style="float:right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div></h3>
        <div>This API can be used to query the data platform for an XML list of Members who meet the set of criteria supplied. The query criteria available to run searches against are fairly comprehensive, 
        but they are simple to understand and this engine is the by far fastest and easiest way to access results when only basic Member information is required. 
        <p/>
        For the times when more detailed data is needed but whilst the query to run remains simple enough not to require the complexity and development skill needed to utilise the <a href="open.aspx">open data platform</a>,
        the API supports a wide variety of additional data ranging from one subset of information through to a full biographical overview of a Member. 
        <p />
        Please bear in mind that the more data that is requested by the consumer, the slower the response from the service.
        </div>

        <a name="urlstructure" />
        <h3>URL structure<div style="float:right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div></h3>
        <div>To access the service in this environment, the following URL is required: <b>http://data.parliament.uk/membersdataplatform/services/mnis/members/query/{search criteria}/{outputs}</b>
        <p />
        The parameter {search criteria} is mandatory, the data passed to it is used by the engine to return a list of Members meeting the criteria specified. The parameter {outputs} is optional, it is used
        to control the amount of data returned for each Member. If this parameter is not set, then the basic schema will be used. For a full list of values supported by the {outputs} parameter see <a href="#outputs">here</a>.
        </div>
        
        <a name="searchcriteria" />
        <h3>Search criteria options<div style="float:right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div></h3>
        <div>The following table lists all of the criteria available to pass to the API in the {search criteria} parameter. To build up a list of criteria, which the query engine will aggregate with the boolean AND 
        operator, simply create a pipe delimited string of the criteria you wish to use.
        <p />
        Two operators are available to most types of search criteria, the equals (=) symbol performs an exact match on the query specified, whereas the asterisk (*) symbol instructs the query engine to perform a more flexible query, the
        exact function of the asterix operator varies from critierion to criterion and is explained in the table.
        <p />
        The correct syntax to pass to the API for a criterion is in the form parameter, operator, value (e.g. house=lords or name*smith). Parameters and values are case-insensitive. Some other example calls to the service are given <a href="#searchexamples">here</a>. It is also possible to pass integer identity values to certain parameters.
        If this is the case then it will be indicated in the table. To access the information needed to use an identifier please use the  <a href="referencedata.aspx">reference data</a> service.
        <p />
        <b>By default, all queries executed will only return current Members of either House.</b> If, for example, a request is made with the criterion house*Commons, the response will include all current Members of the House of Commons, plus
        all current Members of the House of Lords who previously sat in the Commons. In order to receive all Members ever of the House of Commons, it is necessary to add the criterion <b>membership=all</b>. This will tell the query engine to 
        include prior Members in the query results. This will be done automatically in a small number of cases (e.g. when using Member Id field). However in most cases it is necessary to include in the search criteria like any other item. Including the parameter when it is automatically added has no detrimental effect.
        <p />
        Search criteria has been grouped for easy reference into the following categories
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#personalinfotable">Personal information</a></li>
            <li><a href="#membershipinfotable">House memberships</a></li>
            <li><a href="#rolesinfotable">Roles and posts held</a></li>
            <li><a href="#dateinfotable">Date based filters</a></li>
        </ul>
        <a name="personalinfotable" />
        <h4>Criteria to search on personal information</h4>
        In addition to the below, it is also possible to add criteria to search on a Members' age. The parameter is <b>age</b> and the engine will recognise the standard comparison operatiors, <b><=</b>, <b><</b>, <b>>=</b>, <b>></b> and <b>=</b>.
        <p />

        <h3>Data outputs<div style="float:right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div></h3>
        <h4>Core schema</h4>
        <div>
        The API supports returning a variety of content for the search being performed. By default, a basic schema is used to return data and this core data will be returned regardless of what optional parameters are 
        additionally requested. XML is returned in a parent node - Members with each record being contained in a Member node. An example output can be found <a target="_blank" href="xml/member.xml">here</a>.
        <p/>
        It is also possible to request a JSON output. To do this, simply add "application/json" in either the accept or content-type request header.
        <p />
        <h4>Additional data</h4>
        It is possible to request additional data about the Members returned by a query. This additional data is requested in the {outputs} part of the URL must be supplied as a pipe delimited string made up 
        of the options below. A maximum of 3 additional sets of data may be requested for any given call to the API.
        <p/>
        For example, to get a list of committees for a member, the {outputs} section should be Committees (.../Committees). To get a list of committees and experiences, it would read Committees|Experiences (.../Committees|Experiences), and to get house memberships as well, Committees|Experiences|HouseMemberships (.../Committees|Experiences|HouseMemberships).
        <p />
        Where the additional data sets return data with start and end dates, it is possible to detect current/active pieces of data by querying for content where the EndDate element has a value of null (i.e. xml will be  &lt;EndDate xsi:nil="true"/&gt;)
        <p />
        <p /><b>Please note the output type strings are case sensitive.</b>
